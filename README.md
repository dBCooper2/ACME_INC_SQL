# ACME INC. SQL Project

By Trevor Rowland, Matt Mills, and Trey Crockett

## Abstract

This is the final project for DS 3860, my Database Management class at Tennessee Tech. In this project, my team was assigned a list of business rules for a hypothetical client that needed to be implemented in an SQL Database.

The SQL file attached contains tables for handling incoming orders from customers and outgoing orders to vendors, with triggers to keep track of inventory as well as salesperson and vendor ratings.

The schema was tested on Oracle's MySQL platform.
